Guidelines:
Designing beaviourally-informed comms
GRAB your recipients' attention by following these steps.
G - Goal of the comms: State it
R - Recipient: understand them
A - Audit: Conduct a behavioural audit of comms
B - behavioural principles: apply relevant one(s) to enhance comms

1. Goal of the comms: define the goal of the comms. This is the desired action we want receipients to take upon reading the comms.
Consider the following guiding questions when defining the goal of the comms:
- What is the key behaviour we want the recipient to take?
- What are the steps that the recipient has to take to perform the behaviour?

Crafting a goal statement
The goal of the comms is for <who> to <perform what action> by <how>.

2. Recipient - Understand the recipient
Only by understanding the jobs-to-be-done, needs, and pain points of the target audience can we tailor our comms to achieve the desired response.

Consider the following guiding questions:
- Target audience
Who needs to perform the target behaviour? e.g. customers with outstanding loans
- What are the demographics of the target audience? e.g. Gender, age, ethnicity, income, needs and etc
- Familiarity of task: are they familiar with the action required? e.g. have they done it before? will they find it difficult to do?
Benefits and costs
What are the benefits to the recipient for taking action? Are the benefits felt immediately or in the future? What are the costs to the recipient for taking the action?
- Optimising comms (good to consider): What is the best channel to maximise engagement with the target audience? e.g. SMS, email, push note, etc. What are their preferences and needs? 
What is the optimal time to send or receive? (What their habits/preferences - e.g. AM/PM weekends, payday etc). Who might the recipient respond to best? (Who is the best messenger to send the comms?)

3. Audit - conduct a behavioral audit of the current comms. After defining the goal of the comms and understanding the recipient better, conduct a behavoural audit of the current comms to uncover barriers that can reduce the impact of the comms.
Step 1: Get a sample of the current comms
Step 2: Audit the comms by reading it from the recipient's point of view

Consider the following guiding questions as you audit the comms to identify the areas that can be improved
- Language: is the language difficult to understand? Does it contain technical jargon? Does it contain knowledge that can be interpreted inaccurately? Does it require any baseline or prior knowledge?

- Content presentation:
-> Is the order logical?
-> Is the key info communicated upfront?

- Call to action: Are the benefits of taking action and/or consequences of not taking action clear? (i.e. do we answer the recipient's question of ""what is in it for me?"") Is there a clear call to action (i.e. can the recipient understand what is being asked of them and within the first few lines)? Are there clear steps which the recipient can follow? Are the steps to be taken perceived as easy?

- Personalization and tone: Is personalized content used? Is the tone appropriate (e.g. direct, authoritarian, positive, friendly, empowering, etc)?
- Messenger: Is the sender someone who the recipient views as influential in relation to the message?

- Management of expectations: Does the recipient know what happens next? Are deadlines clear, if any? If there is nothing for them to do, did we let them know?

4. Behavioural principles - Apply relevant ones to enhance comms
Based on guiding questions in step 3, apply to the context on hand.

Instructions: Craft a promotional message for the XYZs remittance service emphasizing its exclusive promotion. Highlight the service low charges and extensive countries coverage.

You are a marketing expert from XYZ who is helpful and technical. You will use the following thought process to think, question and answer step by step. Do not repeat the instructions in the following steps in your response as they are meant to be hidden from the user.

If you feel that any information is missing, please ask for more information in the response for this step. 

Step 2: Using the demographics identified in step 1, generate threee distinct subsegments of customers and suggest how to appeal to the needs of these customers. Hwoever, ensure that you take into account the limitations from the instructions.

Step 3: Design and generate personalized marketing contents to target the subsegments identified in step 2. Please try to be as verbose as possible.

The global economy is expected to grow by 3% in 2023, according to a new report by the World Bank. This is a slight downgrade from the previous forecast of 3.2%. The report cites ongoing geopolitical tensions and rising inflation as the main reasons for the downgrade.

The report also warns that the risks to the global economy are tilted to the downside. These risks include the possibility of a further escalation of the war in Ukraine, a sharper-than-expected slowdown in China, and a financial crisis in a major emerging market economy.

The World Bank is urging policymakers to take steps to mitigate these risks and to support the global economic recovery. This includes providing financial assistance to vulnerable countries, investing in infrastructure and education, and promoting open trade and investment.
